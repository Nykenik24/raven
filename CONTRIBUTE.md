-->

3. Make all changes you want in your new fork.
4. Make a pull request to **[this](<https://github.com/C2-Lang/csquared>)** repo.

After making the pull request, we will either:
- Merge your pull request.
- Not merge your pull request AND put comments explaining *why we didn't merge it*.

# For organization/repo members.
If you have **edit permissions** in this repo or the organization as a whole, you **MUST** follow these rules: 
- New, temporary branches must follow this format: `<category>/<topic>`. Per example, if you want to add a new architecture (e.g. ARM) to the compiler, you would call the branch `feature/arch-ARM`.
- If your commit(s) have any changes that are experimental or overall unstable, you **SHALL** first push to the branch `unstable`, and, after making the new feature stable, you now **CAN** push to the `main` branch (opening a pull request first, obviously).
