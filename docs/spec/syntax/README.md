# Syntax
Raven's syntax determines how a Raven program **must look**.

## Abstract syntax
The abstract syntax dictates how the structure of a Raven program is, not necessarily how it looks.

The structure of the *[Abstract Syntax Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree)* of a Raven program MUST always correspond to Raven's abstract syntax.

## Concrete syntax
The abstract syntax might correspond to various concrete ones, even if they are different in style. That's why the *concrete syntax* exists.

The concrete syntax dictates how a Raven program MUST be syntactically. It is formed by various concrete rules, which, if not followed, cause a syntactic error.
